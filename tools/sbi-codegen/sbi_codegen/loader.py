"""Loads 3GPP OpenAPI YAML files and resolves $ref (internal and external,
cross-file) into a schema registry keyed by (source file, type name).

Earlier version of this file keyed the registry by name alone, on the
assumption that "3GPP's OpenAPI files consistently reuse the same schema name
for the same concept across files". That assumption is false in general: it
holds for genuinely shared TS29571_CommonData.yaml-style types referenced via
explicit cross-file $ref, but NOT for schemas two files each define locally
under the same name by coincidence. Checked against the actual R19 YAML
(2026-08-05): of the 5 pilot files, SubscriptionData (Nnrf_NFManagement vs.
Namf_Communication), NFProfile/NFService (Nnrf_NFManagement vs.
Nnrf_NFDiscovery), and Ipv4AddressRange/Ipv6PrefixRange/TransportProtocol/
MbsSession (Nnrf_NFManagement vs. TS29571_CommonData) are all genuinely
different schemas that happen to share a name -- the name-only registry
silently dropped every one of these local redefinitions (first file loaded
wins, no warning), which meant e.g. AMF's real SubscriptionData
(amfStatusUri/guamiList) never reached codegen at all; only NRF's
same-named-but-unrelated SubscriptionData (nfStatusNotificationUri/...) was
ever emitted. See docs/DECISIONS.md ADR-0017. Disambiguation into distinct
C++ type names happens downstream in schema_to_ir.py's Converter, which is
where the actual name collision (as opposed to storage/resolution
correctness, fixed here) gets resolved.
